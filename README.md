# Adjoint Bijective ZoomOut: Efficient upsampling for learned linearly-invariant embedding
This repository is the ufficial implementation of Adjoint Bijective ZoomOut () by G.Viganò and S. Melzi.
This code was written by Giulio Viganò (https://sites.google.com/view/gvigano/home-page).

To train the networks, we refer to the repository of "Correspondence Learning via Lineraly-invariant Embedding" https://github.com/riccardomarin/Diff-FMAPs-PyTorch.
You can find a pre-trained version of the network in the training repository.

To replicate the Paper's results on the FAUST dataset, download the data from https://github.com/riccardomarin/Diff-FMAPs-PyTorch, put the FAUST file in the data folder, and run FAUST_test.py.
